Background / History

The concept of an automated teller machine (ATM) was first introduced in the early 1960s by John Shepherd-Barron, a Scottish inventor. However, it wasn't until 1967 that the first ATM was installed in Enfield, North London, by Barclays Bank. This ATM allowed customers to withdraw cash and check their account balances using a magnetic stripe card.

                                Revolution through ATM
In the 1970s, ATMs began to spread throughout the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe. By the 1980s, they had become commonplace in the United States and Canada. Today, there are over 3 million ATMs in operation worldwide.
ATMs have revolutionized the way people bank. They provide convenient and easy access to cash and other banking services, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. ATMs have also made it possible for people to bank without having to visit a physical bank branch.
